## Description

This in NestJS template for a basic API REST with:

- [Repository Base](#RepositoryBase)
- [Service Base](#ServiceBase)
- [Auditory Entities](#AuditoryEntities)
- Response Interceptor
- [Testing and Coverage](#TestingandCoverage)
- Swagger
- Docker

These implementions were made following the [NestJS documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/).

###BASIC EXPLANATION OF FILES INVOLVED:

## <a name="Authentication"></a>Authentication
The authentication module contains the necessary files for authentication, implemented using Passport with the JWT strategy.
## <a name="Authorization"></a>Authorization
The authorization files are located within the auth module: <b>roles.decorator.ts</b> and <b>roles-auth.guard.ts</b>

Those files were made following the [ NestJS documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/).
## <a name="TypeORMwithMYSQL"></a>TypeORM with MYSQL
If you intend to continue using MySQL, you simply need to create your own <b>.env</b> file following the <b>.env.example</b>. Alternatively, you will need to modify the <b>db.config.ts</b> file.
## <a name="RepositoryBase"></a>Repository Base
This is a basic repository that implements the IRepository interface, offering CRUD operations without implementing soft delete logic.

The file accepts multiple generic classes to facilitate operations.
## <a name="ServiceBase"></a>Service Base
This basic service provides CRUD operations and requires:
- Implemention of the RepositoryBase
- Function to get the body to validate if the resource already exist
- The article used for the resource
- The resource name
- A boolean to determine if it's neccesary to check if the resource already exists

<b>IMPORTANT:</b> Soft deletion has been implemented here, along with filters to retrieve only entities with a state equal to 1.

## <a name="AuditoryEntities"></a>Auditory Entities
The files are inside the auditory module and are: <b>auditory.entity.ts</b> and <b>auditory.suscriber.ts</b>.

For this to work, your new entity needs to extend the AuditoryEntity class, and the subscriber will handle the rest.

## <a name="TestingandCoverage"></a>Testing and Coverage
